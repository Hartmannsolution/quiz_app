          "question": "In the EchoServer of our demo code, why can we only make one request from the client to the server?",
          "answer": "It is because the server is only listening for one request from the client. Once the server receives the request, it sends the response and then closes the connection."

          "question": "What is the purpose of the while loop in the start method of the RequestDataServer?",
          "answer": "It is to enable the server to listen for multiple requests from the client. Once the server receives a request, it sends the response and then goes back to listening for another request."
